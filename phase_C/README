Matching songs from billboard charts to Spotify songs was very challenging. This is because we attempted to match songs in the two datasets by song name + artist name. There is not a standardization of artist names, however. Particularly, the format in which featured artists are concatenated onto the artist name is different between billboard and Spotify (in billboard, there was a standard format, but not in spotify). What we decided to use as our “song match” criteria was that the song names had to match, and the artist name from billboard, after slicing featured artist names off, had to be a substring of the spotify artist. However, we still were not able to get many of the billboard songs matched, due to weird cases such as 'Kesha' in billboard, but'Ke$ha' in Spotify. Thus, for the attributes that come from Spotify only, we have a lot of null values. Thankfully though, this issue seems to mostly affect older or less popular songs/artists where artists names are not as standardized. So most of the tuples for 'top songs' are intact. Moreover, our data is large enough that we still have enough to make meaningful queries. See / run preprocessing_music.py for more clarity.
